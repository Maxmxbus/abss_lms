            <H1>Arakan boys secondary school history</H1><br>
            <p >In 1985, Arakan high secondary school was established in the Zambian army facility in Lusaka. Arakan high secondary school was a co-education intuition but in the year 2012 it was changed into two single sex schools which are now called Arakan boys secondary school and Arakan girls secondary school. Arakan boys secondary schools become a full single sex school in the year 2013. Maj Em Mazubaa   was the first head teacher of Arakan boys secondary school in 1984 while Mrs Em Silenga was the first deputy head teacher of Arakan boys from the year 1984-1987.  Since the establishment of Arakan boys secondary school pupils have been guarded by the previous head teachers and school administration who have made Arakan boys to what it is today.</p>
